# Mask-Detection-and-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning-Keras and Flutter
-------------------------------------------------
1) **Built and Trained a Convolutional Neural Network using Transfer Learning in Tensorflow and Keras inside of Jupyter Notebook.**
> *The script is stored inside the ```Mask Training.ipynb``` file.*
2) **Converted and Exported it as a .tflite asset into a blank Flutter Project**
>  *All app files are in the ```mlxflutter``` folder.*
3) **Finally, wrote a fully functional Flutter mobile app that uses plugins such as tflite and image_picker to use on-device machine learning and now is able to detect 30+ different types of fruits and vegetables, from either a photo taken in real time or an image selected from a camera roll with 97.76% training accuracy and 78.56% validation accuracy**
> *Test this project out yourself, by cloning the repository into Visual Studio Code*
